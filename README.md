# js-examples

Run each example using node.js.

```bash
$ node arguments.js
```

For the ES6 examples, some need to be run in Firefox since certain features are not yet supported in Node 5.  The ES6 compatability table can be found at [https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/).
